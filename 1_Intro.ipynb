    "## What is machine learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) involves training a model to make relevant predictions. Models are created from large amounts of input data, and use of the mathematical relationships between elements in datasets to make  predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of ML systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main types of ML systems, divided according to how they are trained to make their predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised learning \n",
    "\n",
    "With supervised learning, models are trained on large datasets with correct answers provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 core concepts that form the basis of supervised learning:\n",
    "* Data. This includes labels (the values models predict) and features (characteristics; values a model uses to predict labels). The best datasets for ML are large & highly diverse. \n",
    "<img src=\"https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/intro-to-ml/images/labeled_example.png\" alt=\"labels and features\" width=\"70%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model. This is what figures out patterns between elements during the training process.\n",
    "* Training. This is the process of developing a model. \n",
    "* Evaluating/Testing. This involves comparing model predictions to actual (labelled) values from a dataset.\n",
    "* Inference. This involves using the model on unlabelled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common use cases for supervised learning:\n",
    "* Regression models output numeric values (e.g. the price of a house or time required to arrive at a destination). \n",
    "* Classification models (both binary and multiclass) predict the probability that an element belongs to a particular category, and outputs the category with the highest likelihood (e.g. whether or not it will rain tomorrow). \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With supervised learning, models are trained on datasets without any answers provided - the model identifies patterns in the data on its own. A common technique employed is \"clustering\" - the model creates groupings from the data, there can be named and interpted by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With reinforcement learning, models make predictions based on rewards or penalties and determine the policy that maximizes rewards while minimizing penalties (e.g. AI used to play reversi)."
